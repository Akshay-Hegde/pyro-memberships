/**
 * This module allows for the base management of sports teams for a club. The
 * structure is sufficiently generic to allow any sport. It also adds a similar
 * base support for league identification more as a thoughtful design than a
 * smart feature (makes keeping teams in the same leagues easier).
 * I highly recommend you fetch memberships as part of your addon installation.
 * It will allow you to have team rosters with anything from basic players and
 * coaches to whatever your heart desires (I'm having cake bakers).
